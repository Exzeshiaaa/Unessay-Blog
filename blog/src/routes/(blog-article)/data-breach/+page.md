On September 23, 2023, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) issued an official statement regarding a cyber security incident detected on the early morning the day before. In this statement, PhilHealth assured to the members to restore their systems by the 25th and that no personal information and medical information has been compromised or leaked. Unaware of the already impending tragedy, PhilHealth continues to provide their services to thepeople without any subsequent measures. The ignorance and the lack of urgency towards the incidence shows the incompetence of both the data security measures and the system of PhilHealth.

The shift from the age of industrial production to the age of information caused cyber security attacks around the world to increase exponentially in the last decade. These attacks vary in form and are versatile in usage depending on their purpose. In a study by Abomhara and Køien, they defined these attacks to be any actions taken to harm a system or disrupt normal operations by exploiting vulnerabilities using various techniques and tools (73). They also note that the most common types of cyber security attacks are physical attacks, denial-of-service, access attacks, and attacks on privacy amongst many others (74). The attack on PhilHealth’s system is of the form of an attack on privacy specifically called a ransomware attack. The main purpose of these types of attacks mainly involves trading a large sum of money for an access back to the system, data, or any other information. In a literature review by Blancaflor et al., they defined ransomware as:

<Callout type="info">
  “... a severe threat that has been known to interrupt critical services and commercial infrastructures. This extortion software, which gets its name from the word “ransom,” encrypts all the data on the device and demands a ransom or a fee to the user to regain access to it. By preying on their users’ fears of losing essential data, revealing sensitive information, or being locked out of essential resources, this malware type blackmails the victim to pay the ransom.”
</Callout>

Blancaflor’s team describes this attack as an extortion software which basically locks out the admin or users into accessing their data until the negotiated compensation is made. The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation experiencing this type of attack is a major tragedy as it is the largest health insurance corporation in the Philippines that is attached to the government’s Department of Health. Just its members alone comprise of already 70 million people during the year of the attack with over a 100 million beneficiaries. In a later interview, PhilHealth mentioned that the reason why their data system was easily breached was because its anti-virus software expired on April 15, 2023, almost 6 months before the attack happened. Furthermore, when asked about the extent of damage caused by the attack, Data Privacy Officer Nerissa Santiago stated that during their initial analysis they estimate about 13 to 20 million members’ data are leaked including around 600-800 of their employees. Despite these high numbers, the issued statement the day after the attack shows the ignorance, negligence, and the lack of transparency the officials hold towards their members.

This negligence and lack of urgency towards implementing a secure, efficient, and effective security measure towards their data resulted to one of the biggest data leaks since the `Comeleak` incident, as well as an invasion of privacy and security towards 13 to 20 million Filipinos. The fact that it was medical data that was leaked makes the incident worse because this data is significantly more valuable than other data. Czeschik, in her study entitled “Black Market Value of Patient Data”, notes that the value of healthcare data is significantly higher than various types of financial records such as bank accounts which is ranked the second most valuable (1). Additionally, Experian says that a single patient data can cost around 1000 dollars in comparison to a financial record whose value is at 5 dollars. What makes medical data so valuable is its rarity and demand by institutions around the world for research. Furthermore, medical data unlike other data can’t be tampered with or changed since these are personal data and are linked to your life and growth. A stolen credit card for example can be disconnected, and changed by one call to the bank provider while a person who knows your blood type will forever know it.

In the interview with PhilHealth’s officials, they mentioned that the Medusa group, the one responsible for the attack, asked for a lump of money amounting to 300,000 dollars or 17 million pesos in value. The state insurer stressed that it would, in no circumstances, pay for such a large amount. And while this may have been the correct move, this caused the data of 13 to 20 million Filipinos to be leaked in the black market, available for everyone around the world to download for free even today. In a study about medical data leaks by Rauti et al., they quoted:

<Callout type="info">
    “Individuals deem health data highly sensitive and personal, which makes leaking this data a serious privacy violation not only in law but also in an individual's mind. Very few people want information on their medical conditions, treatments, and medication to reach unauthorized sources. Health data leaks to unauthorized third parties strongly violate an individual's right to privacy rights, which can lead to a sense of vulnerability and loss of trust in medical websites and healthcare systems in general. This can be especially detrimental to groups that are vulnerable to begin with.”

Rauti and their team also discusses that leakage of medical data may affect the victims personal and professional lives, causing social exclusions. One specific example they discussed is how individuals could be denied employment, insurance coverage, or experience a biased treatment due to their health. At the end Rauti and their team also stated that:

<Callout type="info">
    “It is also not impossible that some third parties exploit health data leaks for financial gain. In theory, the data could be sold to another external party... Health data is very valuable: if a user's credit card number leaks, the card can be replaced but health data can contain lots of information that stays valid forever.”
</Callout>

Rauti’s team clearly discusses several implications of having your medical data leaked.
While PhilHealth failed to prevent such an incident from happening, it is also important to
discuss their actions towards the incident after it happened. This includes paying compensation
to the victims, being transparent to what happened, enforcing the system, and fixing up
temporary measures to provide service again. There were several steps that PhilHealth took as a
response to this incident. The first and foremost action they took was to inform the public and its
members of the data leak and educated them to be wary of phishing attacks, and usage of their
personal information against them. While they were not fully transparent at what happened
during the issuing of the statement, it was good that they informed the public of their failure and
instructed them to be aware of this incident.

Furthermore, they also partnered with NPC to issue a website where you can view if your
data are amongst the leaked data to the public. This is important since this action helped relieve
anxiety towards the people whose data haven’t been leaked as well as spark more caution
towards those whose data were. PhilHealth also ensured that a new antivirus software costing 14
million pesos was implemented swiftly making sure that there are security systems in place. This
incident also sparked the National Privacy Commission (NPC) and the Department of
Information and Communications Technology to forge a partnership towards an implementation of a digital security and privacy quick response (DSPQR) whose main goal is to swiftly address
privacy violations and concerns. While there were many steps PhilHealth took to minimize
damage, there were no reports of compensations made to the victims for the traumatizing
experience they had.

It is also important to question the root of the incidence and make sure that this is no
longer a cause for worry for future attacks. In their interview PhilHealth mentioned that their
subscription towards the antivirus software expired on April 15, 2023, and due to taxing
government procedures, they couldn’t swiftly replace the system with a new antivirus software.
While Philippine government procedures indeed take a long time and are inefficient, 6 months is
a long time to leave the system unprotected from any cyber-attack. Other measures could have
been implemented such as additional security measures, shutting down the system, making a
temporary local IP server, and most of all keeping in track the subscription viability and
processing it even before it ending. The lack of action from PhilHealth and the inefficiency of the
government such requests until an incident occurs shows how ineffective the system of data
security of both the government and PhilHealth is.

If no actions are taken towards implementing a better system for data security in the
Philippines, there would be several more cases like this incidence in the near future. In fact, in
the literature review by Blancaflor et al., they stated that:

<Callout type="info">
    “... there is a concerning gap in cybersecurity expertise among Philippine’s enterprises
    and organizations. Nearly 45% of these businesses lack the requisite cybersecurity
    capabilities to safeguard themselves, and 48% of the respondents said it was challenging
    to find qualified cybersecurity personnel... If the Philippines wants to reap the benefits
    brought by the digital world, they should examine and improve their cybersecurity
    programs fast”
</Callout>

The percentages shown in this study should be a major concern not only for business
owners and government officials but also the citizens living in the Philippines. The lack of
concern and urgency for measures to be implemented from the citizens allows the administrating
personnel to slack off on giving the due security they owe to the people for trusting them to
handle their data. Being aware of the repercussions and importance of data security is the first
step to ensuring that our privacies are handled responsibly and whoever fails to protect them
should be held accountable.

Data security, in the Philippines, is often an ignored topic despite the news reaching both
the local and global level. This is because information regarding this is scarce and not
disseminated properly. Aside from making sure that the proper systems are implemented, the
government should provide talks, news, or any sort of information regarding the importance and
implications of not satisfying the requirement of a security system.
