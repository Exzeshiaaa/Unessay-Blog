An army dressed in red, a crimson sky, and a wall of fire. It was the start of the Hundred Year War, and the peace between the nations was broken. This is how viewers were introduced to the story of Avatar: The Last Airbender (ATLA). In this world, there are people who can control one of the four elements: water, earth, fire, or air. Society is divided into four main nations, one for each element. In the center of it all is the Avatar, the only person who can control all of the elements and is burdened with the purpose of keeping the balance in the world. There was peace until the Fire Nation attacked.

The balance of the world in ATLA was broken when the Fire Nation started its conquest to invade the other three nations. The regime destroyed cities and villages, oppressed civilians, established colonies on conquered lands, and even destroyed a nation. For three seasons, the story follows Aang, the current avatar and the last member of the Air Nomads, as he attempts to end the colonial rule of the Fire Nation and bring back the balance of the world. Throughout the series, Aang and the viewers were shown the effects of the colonization inside and outside the colonies. <u>Avatar: The Last Airbender portrays the impacts of colonization and how it serves as the common root of political, societal, and cultural challenges faced within its world, which leads to the characters’ struggle for liberation and quest for restoring the balance of the world.</u> As such, this paper will mainly analyze the three seasons of the animated series.

The origin of the conflict in ATLA, known as the Hundred Year War, can be traced back to Fire Lord Sozin, who ruled the Fire Nation a century before the events of the series. He rationalized the nation’s invasion as a form of altruism for the rest of the world. In one of his conversations with the previous Avatar, he said:

<Callout type="info">
  “Our nation is enjoying an unprecedented time of peace and wealth. Our people are happy, and we’re so fortunate in so many ways. I’ve been thinking, we should share this prosperity with the rest of the world. In our hands is the most successful empire in history. It’s time we expanded it. ("The Avatar and the Fire Lord" 12:33)”
</Callout>

It is interesting to note how Sozin framed the Fire Nation as prosperous and that the other nations should also experience the same abundance, but then immediately emphasized his expansionist aim. Extending the influence of the Fire Nation was the underlying agenda for helping others. Indeed, throughout his reign, Sozin established several colonies, and his successors continued his goal. Instead of sharing the wealth, the Fire Nation sought control over the neighboring nations and their resources. Their actions can be considered colonial in nature, particularly when Putri and Clayton’s description of colonialism is considered:

<Callout type="info">
  “…colonialism was a form of domination, or the control by individuals or groups over the territory and/or behavior of other individuals or groups… It is important that the differences between colonialism and imperialism is understood as people often use the terms interchangeably. They are, in fact, two different words and have a slight difference in meaning. Both terms convey the concept of economic and political domination and oppression of the colonized/the other. However, the key difference between colonialism and imperialism is the presence or absence of significant numbers of permanent settlers in the colony from the colonizing power. (3)”
</Callout>

Moreover, Sozin’s words imply that their nation was more fortunate, and also revealed his belief in their superiority, just as colonialists see their culture as a superior culture (Kortright). This ideology remained in the Fire Nation, enduring even decades after the death of Sozin at the start of the series. This results in several political, cultural, and societal challenges.

he Fire Nation’s expansionist agenda led them to wage war with the other three nations. Through their military and naval fleet, they established colonies across the Earth Kingdom and Air Nomad lands. These territories also served as military outposts and contributed to the war effort. As the locations of these colonies are relatively far from the nation’s homeland, they have a relative degree of autonomy. Fire Nation officials or military officers typically lead these settlements, who often abuse and exploit the native population. In one of the episodes, an Earth Kingdom mining village was forced to mine coal for the Fire Navy (“Imprisoned"). It is intriguing that resources such as coal and iron are abundant in the main archipelago of the Fire Nation, yet the colonies were still exploited in gathering these materials (Avatar: The Last Airbender). However, it can be noticed that most of these resources were used throughout the series to power the nation’s coal-powered technology. It can then be inferred that the colonization was not only to expand their territory but also to aid the industrialization of the country. In one of his papers, Naidu discussed industrialization-driven colonization:

<Callout type="info">
  “Industrialization is built upon the availability of certain basic elements of economy – food, raw materials, human power, energy, capital, trade and markets. These elements could be available domestically or be obtained from foreign lands… Economic exploitation could not be carried out without suppression and oppression by autocratic-science-technology… As the demands of industrialization kept increasing, domestic resources became inadequate very quickly. European industrialists had then to resort to foreign colonial exploitation. (3)”
</Callout>

To further realize their expansionist agenda, the Fire Nation tried to remove their greatest obstacle: the Avatar. One of the incarnations of the Avatar had already opposed Sozin’s ideas of one great nation. To prevent any future interventions, the Fire Lord ordered his army to kill everyone in the incarnated Avatar’s nation. As such, the Hundred Year War started with the genocide of the Air Nomads. Along with the annihilation of its people, the spiritual techniques, traditions, temples, and culture of the airbenders were severely endangered. Despite Aang’s survival, he remained the sole practitioner of the Air Nomad culture.

Aside from the airbenders, the cultures of the Earth Kingdom natives were also altered in the colonies. While some traditions were preserved, it can be observed that, throughout the series, the culture of the Fire Nation was given more emphasis and importance. For example, students in a Fire Nation school learn that the Air Nomads had an army, despite it being false (“The Headband”). The education system in the colonies and the homeland did teach history, but it was altered to favor the Fire Nation by vilifying the other nations. This echoes Sozin’s belief in the supremacy of their culture. Indeed, Dirks wrote in his paper that colonization also involved cultural factors:

<Callout type="info">
  “Although colonial conquest was predicated on the power of superior arms, military organization, political power, and economic wealth, it was also based on a complexly related variety of cultural technologies. Colonialism not only has had cultural effects that have too often been either ignored or displaced into the inexorable logics of modernization and world capitalism, it was itself a cultural project of control. Colonial knowledge both enabled colonial conquest and was produced by it; in certain important ways, culture was what colonialism was all about. Cultural forms in newly classified “traditional” societies were reconstructed and transformed by and through colonial technologies of conquest and rule, which created new categories and oppositions between colonizers and colonized. (3)”
</Callout>

As colonies kept being established on Earth Kingdom lands, some of the citizens fled, seeking refuge in other regions such as the capital, Ba Sing Se. Instead of the risk of staying in the colonies, they choose to take on the challenge of immigration. However, transportation to these territories required passports. In one of the scenes, the ticket lady angrily rejects Aang’s request for tickets:

<Callout type="info">
  “No passports, no tickets! No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy-nilly to anyone, there would be no more order! You know what that means, no more civilization! (“The Serpent’s Pass” 8:05)”
</Callout>

It is interesting to note the importance of ‘civilization’ in her speech. Despite the city being able to accommodate these people, they used this mentality as a means to reject immigrants. This is a problem for the refugees who lack documentation. Left with no choice, they take a more dangerous route just to enter the city. This is similar to the situation of some of the citizens in Africa and the Middle East:

<Callout type="info">
  “A Eurocentric thinking, reinforced by technological and scientific achievements in the West, continues to be very present in the former colonies. This is why citizens of the war-torn and poverty-ridden postcolonial nations yearn to flee to Europe in spite of the risks involved in crossing the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean Sea (Faiola, 2015; Moulson, 2016) to get to perceived freedom and safety in Europe and a better life for themselves and their families. (Fonkem 60)”
</Callout>

While Earth Kingdom citizens have the choice of seeking refuge in their capital, the Water Tribes have fewer places to go. For example, the waterbenders of the Southern Water Tribe were either captured or killed, and while a colony was not established on their lands, they remained under threat of raids from the Fire Nation. This results in communities nearing extinction and slow technological advancement. The assaults also caused trauma to members of the tribe, like Katara, who lost her mother in one of the attacks by the army.

The continued oppression and colonization efforts of the Fire Nation were not without resistance. Several of the colonies in the Earth Kingdom chose to fight back, such as the Mining Village discussed before. A notable example is the group Freedom Fighters led by Jet, who uses guerilla techniques to sabotage the Fire Nation army (“Jet”). However, the group takes such extreme measures to fight for their goals that they do not mind, even if Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation civilians are killed in the process. Another significant resistance against the colonization is by the current Avatar, Aang, and his companions. As they journeyed across the world, they not only liberated the colonies under the Fire Nation but also forged alliances across all the nations. It is actions such as these that shake the foundation of the colonial system, which was discussed by Icoz in her paper:

<Callout type="info">
  “Resistance is substantially the mastery of opposition, to have power to counter by creating a new action. It is sometimes an attempt to create a revolutionary border thinking practice; it opens the channels for a different way of thinking. It also operates on the circumferences of the hegemonic culture, which tries to relegate resistance to a frivolous or weak position. The goal or the direction of resistance is towards a change. In the performing of resistance, the two leading actors at work are action and opposition. While action is not "a state of being" (Hollander, Einwohner 539), but contains a sense of active behaviour, opposition can be best defined with the words "challenge", "contradict", and "conflict" and so on. (113)”
</Callout>

Within the Fire Nation itself, resistance movements were present, which prominently included Prince Zuko, the great-grandson of Fire Lord Sozin. While he initially pursued to capture the Avatar, Zuko’s journey led him to recognize the wrongdoings of his nations. In one of the episodes, he confronted his father, Fire Lord Ozai:

<Callout type="info">
  “Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don't see our greatness. They hate us! And we deserve it! We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness. (“The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse” 10:45)”
</Callout>

It is interesting to note that Zuko did not separate himself from the Fire Nation; instead, he acknowledges the need for their nation to change for the betterment of the world. Ultimately, he joined forces with Aang to take down the colonial regime.

Within three seasons, Avatar: The Last Airbender was able to explore the impacts of colonization within its world. The systematic oppression inside and outside the colonies emphasized the reach and consequences of the expansionist ideals of a single nation. The political, societal, and cultural challenges that emerged are shown to be deeply interconnected with each other. Despite these odds, the people resisted and fought for their freedom. Finally, after a hundred years, the Fire Nation was defeated. While all the things that changed and events that unfolded during the colonization period cannot be easily erased, the first step towards restoring the balance of the world has already been taken.
