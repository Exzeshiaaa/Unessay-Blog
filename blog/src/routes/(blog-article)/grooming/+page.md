Within the rich and vibrant culture of Philippine society, there is a pervasive issue faced by many of its people. Grooming and pedophilia are two interrelated yet distinct phenomena that affect the innocence of a child and ruin trust not only among communities but also within families. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, grooming is defined as the establishment of a trusting relationship with a minor with the intention of exploiting them, particularly for nonconsensual sexual acts. While pedophilia is a sexual perversion or psychiatric disorder where an adult has sexual fantasies or performs sexual acts on prepubescent children. As these dangerous acts exist in our society, it is of great importance that we shine a spotlight on these taboo subjects in order to provide better intervention and protection for its victims. <u>Analyzing the characteristics, effects, cultural factors, and societal responses surrounding grooming and pedophilia is important to know the specific actions we must take for a more resilient Philippine society.</u>

# Characteristics of Grooming

According to Noggle (qtd. in Collings 2), the key characteristic of grooming is the involvement of psychological manipulation, which is neither coercion nor rational persuasion. Coercion typically involves the use of threats and force to control someone’s action, while rational persuasion uses logic and reason. Grooming, on the other hand, uses subtler techniques such as emotional manipulation, either by flattery, showing affection, or giving incentives. However, the study by Wolf and Pruitt (350) suggests that there is a type of grooming that uses verbal coercion, and it is the most common method used by perpetrators to make their victims comply. They also suggest that there are grooming tactics that employ the use of threats or violence. In addition, the typical target of groomers are children who exhibit low self-esteem, emotional or mental health challenges, or a tendency for risky behaviors, as these traits make the child more vulnerable to manipulation by the groomer (Collings 3). These strategies are aimed at creating a sense of dependency for the child on the perpetrator (Collings 4). This manipulation not only affects the child's sense of autonomy but also distorts their understanding of healthy relationships and boundaries. Since children are also relatively immature, there is an imbalance of power between the groomer and the child. Hence, the child cannot give truly informed and voluntary consent to the acts of grooming (Collings 3).

Additionally, groomers desensitize children to sexual content by encouraging discussions about sex, portraying sexual exploitation as normal, beneficial, or done out of love, and sharing pornographic material. These tactics are employed to condition the child to accept any intrusive forms of sexual contact. This is also done as an effort to maintain secrecy surrounding these activities (Collings 4). Because of this, the abuse is being normalized, minimizing the child's ability to recognize and report exploitation. 

It is also important to note that groomers target not only children but also the parents or caretakers of the child. They create a fake image of themselves as trustworthy and respectable in order to have opportunities to be alone with the child (Collings, 4). This targeting not only increases the likelihood of successful grooming but also complicates efforts to identify and intervene in cases of abuse.

# Characteristics of Pedophilia

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (qtd. in Hall and Hall 522), identified a pedophile as a person who experiences sexual arousal, fantasies, or urges that are directed to prepubescent children, usually under the age of 13, and last more than six months. Pedophiles may use subtle tactics of manipulation, such as grooming, in order to exploit a child. They may also justify their actions by framing their behavior as beneficial or consensual, evading accountability for their harmful actions (O’Leary qtd. in Collings 5). These tactics are the reason why the cycle of abuse continues, and they also contribute to the culture of victim-blaming that often surrounds cases of child sexual exploitation.

While some researchers suggest that there is a correlation between grooming and pedophilia, this assertion lacks consistent proof from studies (O’Leary qtd. in Collings 5). Even though some individuals who engage in grooming may indeed exhibit traits of pedophilia or other psychological disorders, it is important to note that groomers do not always have underlying mental disorders. Instead, grooming is simply a strategy used by individuals that seeks to exploit and manipulate vulnerable children for their own benefit.

# Effects of Grooming and Pedophilia

Due to the nature of both grooming and pedophilia, these usually result in child sexual abuse (CSA) cases. According to Wolf and Pruitt, “a byproduct of this is the isolation and normalization of deviant relationship interactions experienced by the child victim. This in turn exacerbates the trauma of the sexual assault and makes the healing process more arduous” (345). Thus, grooming and pedophilia leave lasting scars that extend far beyond the physical act of abuse. In fact, the common symptoms of CSA are depression, anxiety, psychopathology, dissociation, post-traumatic stress responses, substance abuse, sexual dysfunction, physical ailments, somatization, lower socioeconomic status, and interpersonal difficulties. The severity of these cases is often affected by the type of victim-offender relationship, the type of abuse experienced, the age of onset, and the timing of disclosure (Wolf and Pruitt 346).

# Grooming and Pedophilia in the Philippine Society

Grooming is alarmingly normalized in the Philippines, with many different accounts from its victims. Children who are either groomed by someone they thought they could trust, a family member, a family friend, or even individuals outside their immediate circle. There are various factors that normalize grooming in the Philippines, such as culture, technology, and media representations.

In Filipino culture, authority figures are given much respect. This can be exploited by groomers. They can use their authority to exploit and manipulate children and not raise any suspicion. For example, two teachers were caught grooming their students after their students came forward with sexual abuse allegations (Chi). These teachers were in a position of authority, which they used to exploit their students. Moreover, there is a pervasive stigma surrounding discussions of sexuality and abuse in Filipino society that often leads to silence and shame, which makes it difficult for victims to seek help. In the case of the teachers who groomed their students, only a few victims testified against the perpetrators. According to the article, one of the reasons that survivors of sexual assault struggle to seek help is the fear that nobody will believe them (Chi). This may be influenced by how victim-blaming is prevalent in our society and how people avoid topics of abuse. Additionally, the traditional concept of "utang na loob" can make the victims feel that they are indebted to the groomers since groomers usually offer gifts to establish trust and exploit the victims. One social worker shared the following account:

<Callout type="info">
  “Pina-aral pa yan sa international school, and then talagang well-provided ang kanilang material needs, kaya nga itong mga bata na ’to nung magte-testify hirap na hirap din kasi akala nila parang good man si…” (She was enrolled in an international school and then all the materials were provided, that is why these children had a hard time testifying against the perpetrator because they think he is a good man) (Tarroja et al. 31)”
</Callout>

Which demonstrated how groomers successfully manipulate children through giving gifts, gaining their trust, and exploiting the “utang na loob” culture.

These cultural factors, which are rooted in the traditions and values of Filipinos, contribute to the normalization of grooming and further exacerbate the act of grooming in communities.

In addition, technology and the internet provided new ways for groomers to victimize children. This increases the risk of successful grooming and poses additional challenges for child protection efforts. Tarroja et al. have written a comprehensive report on online sexual abuse and exploitation of children (OSAEC) in the Philippines. They have detailed that online grooming exists, and explicit sexual conversations online do not always exist in such cases. The intention of perpetrators is to meet the child and abuse them in person (O’Connel qtd. in Tarroja et al. 7). Since there are no explicit sexual conversations, it would be harder to detect grooming. The internet also poses an additional challenge since child abuse materials are now easily passed on, with some groomers using it as a way to earn money (Europol qtd. in Tarroja et al. 7). The Dark Web is no longer needed to distribute such material. In fact, OSAEC activities are easily done through Facebook and other usual social media platforms (Tarroja et al. 71). This is very alarming and puts children at greater risk now that the internet is easily accessible.

Furthermore, the way relationships are portrayed in the media, especially in Philippine show business and online media, can romanticize or normalize grooming behaviors. For instance, older adults pursuing romantic relationships with significantly younger people may be seen in some media. This can make a large age gap in a relationship seem normal, even if one of the people in the relationship is of legal age and the other one is a minor. This blurs the line between appropriate and inappropriate behavior, which can desensitize audiences to the seriousness of these concerns and make it easier for perpetrators to groom future victims.

# Societal Responses

Tarroja et al. have recommended a framework in response to OSAEC. The review of existing laws and policies and the collaboration of both government and non-government are needed to be able to properly execute the prevention, identification, reporting, rescue, trial, and aftercare of cases. Supporting the development of the children involved in OSAEC cases also requires programs for mental and physical health as well as educational assistance. In fact, successfully reintegrated child victims who received aftercare treatment and rescue were even inspired to campaign for OSAEC prevention (XIV). They also provided recommended actions to support the family and community involved in such cases. This involves providing reform programs, spreading awareness in communities, and others that would be helpful in the prevention and intervention of such cases (XV). The government could also follow the recommended actions detailed in the report to enhance the operations of the involved agencies to better serve the people affected (XVI–XVII). It is also important to recognize and call out the inefficiency of some government institutions, such as DepEd.

These actions presented by Tarroja et al. are not only applicable in cases of online grooming sexual abuse but also in cases that do not involve online platforms.

The report also addressed both the harm of technology and the internet being easily accessible. The poor computer literacy of children and their parents puts the children at great risk of being victimized by abusers. Thus, focus must be put on making the child and parent vigilant and providing them with knowledge to combat OSAEC. Even though technology and internet connections can be harmful, they can also be used to spread awareness about OSAEC and grooming by providing a hotline for community members to report possible OSAEC activities and filtering content that is shared over the internet (XIV).

# Conclusion

Grooming and pedophilia are serious and sensitive topics that are often overlooked due to the manipulative nature of these cases and the cultural and social factors involved that normalize grooming and pedophilic activities. Being aware is an important factor in the prevention and intervention of the harmful impacts brought about by this. Knowing the tactics of groomers and how they target vulnerable children, build a trusting relationship with them and their parents or caregivers, and sexually exploit them is essential in identifying cases and protecting their victims. The cultural and societal factors that influence the normalization of grooming in the Philippines are also important to look at to provide us with nuanced judgment in creating actions and policies for the victims of abuse. It also helps us reflect on how certain cultural values might be toxic and hinder the growth of our nation. By spreading awareness and giving physical, mental, and educational assistance to our citizens, we could be able to promote a more progressive society that protects the welfare of each citizen, especially those who are in great vulnerability.
